/*
Package btree provides a very specific set implementation for k/v
lookup.  This is based on a B PALM tree as described here:
http://irvcvcs01.intel-research.net/publications/palm.pdf

This tree is best interacted with in batches.  Insertions and deletions
are optimized for dealing with large amounts of data.

Future work includes:

1) Optimization
2) Range scans

Usage:

rt := New(config)
mutable := rt.AsMutable()
... operations

rt, err := mutable.Commit() // saves all mutated nodes

.. rt reading/operations

Once a mutable has been committed, its further operations are undefined.
