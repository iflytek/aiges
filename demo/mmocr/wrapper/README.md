MMOCR is an open-source toolbox based on PyTorch and mmdetection for text detection, text recognition, and the corresponding downstream tasks including key information extraction. It is part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The main branch works with **PyTorch 1.6+**.

Documentation: https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

### Major Features

- **Comprehensive Pipeline**

   The toolbox supports not only text detection and text recognition, but also their downstream tasks such as key information extraction.

- **Multiple Models**

  The toolbox supports a wide variety of state-of-the-art models for text detection, text recognition and key information extraction.

- **Modular Design**

  The modular design of MMOCR enables users to define their own optimizers, data preprocessors, and model components such as backbones, necks and heads as well as losses. Please refer to [Getting Started](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) for how to construct a customized model.

- **Numerous Utilities**

  The toolbox provides a comprehensive set of utilities which can help users assess the performance of models. It includes visualizers which allow visualization of images, ground truths as well as predicted bounding boxes, and a validation tool for evaluating checkpoints during training.  It also includes data converters to demonstrate how to convert your own data to the annotation files which the toolbox supports.
