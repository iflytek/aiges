# Changelog

## 0.5.0 (31/03/2022)

### Highlights

1. MMOCR now supports SPACE recognition! (What a prominent feature!) Users only need to convert the recognition annotations that contain spaces from a plain `.txt` file to JSON line format `.jsonl`, and then revise a few configurations to enable the `LineJsonParser`. For more information, please read our step-by-step [tutorial](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/blank_recog.html).
2. [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) is now available in MMOCR! While MMOCR is more flexible to support various downstream tasks, users might sometimes not be satisfied with DL models and would like to turn to effective legacy solutions. Therefore, we offer this option in `mmocr.utils.ocr` by wrapping Tesseract as a detector and/or recognizer. Users can easily create an MMOCR object by `MMOCR(det=’Tesseract’, recog=’Tesseract’)`.

3. We release data converters for **16** widely used OCR datasets, including multiple scenarios such as document, handwritten, and scene text. Now it is more convenient to generate annotation files for these datasets. Check the dataset zoo ( [Det](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets/det.html#) & [Recog](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets/recog.html) ) to explore further information.
4. Special thanks to @EighteenSprings @BeyondYourself @yangrisheng, who had actively participated in documentation translation!

### Migration Guide - ResNet

Some refactoring processes are still going on. For text recognition models, we unified the [`ResNet-like` architectures](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/blob/72f945457324e700f0d14796dd10a51535c01a57/mmocr/models/textrecog/backbones/resnet.py) which are used as backbones. By introducing stage-wise and block-wise plugins, the refactored ResNet is highly flexible to support existing models, like ResNet31 and ResNet45, and other future designs of ResNet variants.

#### Plugin

- `Plugin` is a module category inherited from MMCV's implementation of `PLUGIN_LAYERS`, which can be inserted between each stage of ResNet or into a basicblock. You can find a simple implementation of plugin at [mmocr/models/textrecog/plugins/common.py](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/blob/72f945457324e700f0d14796dd10a51535c01a57/mmocr/models/textrecog/plugins/common.py), or click the button below.

    <summary>Plugin Example</summary>

    ```python
    @PLUGIN_LAYERS.register_module()
    class Maxpool2d(nn.Module):
        """A wrapper around nn.Maxpool2d().

        Args:
            kernel_size (int or tuple(int)): Kernel size for max pooling layer
            stride (int or tuple(int)): Stride for max pooling layer
            padding (int or tuple(int)): Padding for pooling layer
        """

        def __init__(self, kernel_size, stride, padding=0, **kwargs):
            super(Maxpool2d, self).__init__()
            self.model = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size, stride, padding)

        def forward(self, x):
            """
            Args:
                x (Tensor): Input feature map

            Returns:
                Tensor: The tensor after Maxpooling layer.
            """
            return self.model(x)
    ```

    </details>

#### Stage-wise Plugins

- ResNet is composed of stages, and each stage is composed of blocks. E.g., ResNet18 is composed of 4 stages, and each stage is composed of basicblocks. For each stage, we provide two ports to insert stage-wise plugins by giving `plugins` parameters in ResNet.

    ```text
    [port1: before stage] ---> [stage] ---> [port2: after stage]
    ```

- E.g. Using a ResNet with four stages as example. Suppose we want to insert an additional convolution layer before each stage, and an additional convolution layer at stage 1, 2, 4. Then you can define the special ResNet18 like this

    ```python
    resnet18_speical = ResNet(
            # for simplicity, some required
            # parameters are omitted
            plugins=[
                dict(
                    cfg=dict(
                    type='ConvModule',
                    kernel_size=3,
                    stride=1,
                    padding=1,
                    norm_cfg=dict(type='BN'),
                    act_cfg=dict(type='ReLU')),
                    stages=(True, True, True, True),
                    position='before_stage')
                dict(
                    cfg=dict(
                    type='ConvModule',
                    kernel_size=3,
                    stride=1,
                    padding=1,
                    norm_cfg=dict(type='BN'),
                    act_cfg=dict(type='ReLU')),
                    stages=(True, True, False, True),
                    position='after_stage')
            ])
    ```

- You can also insert more than one plugin in each port and those plugins will be executed in order. Let's take ResNet in [MASTER](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02562) as an example:

    <details close>
    <summary>Multiple Plugins Example</summary>

    - ResNet in Master is based on ResNet31. And after each stage, a module named `GCAModule` will be used. The `GCAModule` is inserted before the stage-wise convolution layer in ResNet31. In conlusion, there will be two plugins at `after_stage` port in the same time.

        ```python
        resnet_master = ResNet(
                        # for simplicity, some required
                        # parameters are omitted
                        plugins=[
                            dict(
                                cfg=dict(type='Maxpool2d', kernel_size=2, stride=(2, 2)),
                                stages=(True, True, False, False),
                                position='before_stage'),
                            dict(
                                cfg=dict(type='Maxpool2d', kernel_size=(2, 1), stride=(2, 1)),
                                stages=(False, False, True, False),
                                position='before_stage'),
                            dict(
                                cfg=dict(type='GCAModule', kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),
                                stages=[True, True, True, True],
                                position='after_stage'),
                            dict(
                                cfg=dict(
                                    type='ConvModule',
                                    kernel_size=3,
                                    stride=1,
                                    padding=1,
                                    norm_cfg=dict(type='BN'),
                                    act_cfg=dict(type='ReLU')),
                                stages=(True, True, True, True),
                                position='after_stage')
                        ])

        ```

        </details>

  - In each plugin, we will pass two parameters (`in_channels`, `out_channels`) to support operations that need the information of current channels.

#### Block-wise Plugin (Experimental)

- We also refactored the `BasicBlock` used in ResNet. Now it can be customized with block-wise plugins. Check [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/blob/72f945457324e700f0d14796dd10a51535c01a57/mmocr/models/textrecog/layers/conv_layer.py) for more details.
- BasicBlock is composed of two convolution layer in the main branch and a shortcut branch. We provide four ports to insert plugins.

    ```text
        [port1: before_conv1] ---> [conv1] --->
        [port2: after_conv1] ---> [conv2] --->
        [port3: after_conv2] ---> +(shortcut) ---> [port4: after_shortcut]
    ```

- In each plugin, we will pass a parameter `in_channels` to support operations that need the information of current channels.
- E.g. Build a ResNet with customized BasicBlock with an additional convolution layer before conv1:

                    cfg=dict(type='Maxpool2d',
                    kernel_size=2,
                    stride=(2, 2)),
                    stages=(True, True, False, False),
                    position='before_stage'),
                dict(
                    cfg=dict(type='Maxpool2d',
                    kernel_size=(2, 1),
                    stride=(2, 1)),
                    stages=(False, False, True, False),
                    position='before_stage'),
                dict(
                    cfg=dict(
                    type='ConvModule',
                    kernel_size=3,
                    stride=1,
                    padding=1,
                    norm_cfg=dict(type='BN'),
                    act_cfg=dict(type='ReLU')),
                    stages=(True, True, True, True),
                    position='after_stage')
            ])

<summary>ResNet with plugins</summary>

- ResNet31 is a typical architecture to use stage-wise plugins. Before the first three stages, Maxpooling layer is used. After each stage, a convolution layer with BN and ReLU is used.

    ```python
    resnet_31 = ResNet(
        in_channels=3,
        stem_channels=[64, 128],
        block_cfgs=dict(type='BasicBlock'),
        arch_layers=[1, 2, 5, 3],
        arch_channels=[256, 256, 512, 512],
        strides=[1, 1, 1, 1],
        plugins=[
            dict(
                cfg=dict(type='Maxpool2d',
                kernel_size=2,
                stride=(2, 2)),
                stages=(True, True, False, False),
                position='before_stage'),
            dict(
                cfg=dict(type='Maxpool2d',
                kernel_size=(2, 1),
                stride=(2, 1)),
                stages=(False, False, True, False),
                position='before_stage'),
            dict(
                cfg=dict(
                type='ConvModule',
                kernel_size=3,
                stride=1,
                padding=1,
                norm_cfg=dict(type='BN'),
                act_cfg=dict(type='ReLU')),
                stages=(True, True, True, True),
                position='after_stage')
        ])
    ```

### Migration Guide - Dataset Annotation Loader

The annotation loaders, `LmdbLoader` and `HardDiskLoader`, are unified into `AnnFileLoader` for a more consistent design and wider support on different file formats and storage backends. `AnnFileLoader` can load the annotations from `disk`(default), `http` and `petrel` backend, and parse the annotation in `txt` or `lmdb` format. `LmdbLoader` and `HardDiskLoader` are deprecated, and users are recommended to modify their configs to use the new `AnnFileLoader`. Users can migrate their legacy loader `HardDiskLoader` referring to the following example:

```python
# Legacy config
train = dict(
    type='OCRDataset',
    ...
    loader=dict(
        type='HardDiskLoader',
        ...))

# Suggested config
train = dict(
    type='OCRDataset',
    ...
    loader=dict(
        type='AnnFileLoader',
        file_storage_backend='disk',
        file_format='txt',
        ...))
```

Similarly, using `AnnFileLoader` with `file_format='lmdb'` instead of `LmdbLoader` is strongly recommended.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1

## v0.4.0 (15/12/2021)

### Highlights

1. We release a new text recognition model - [ABINet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06495.pdf) (CVPR 2021, Oral). With it dedicated model design and useful data augmentation transforms, ABINet can achieve the best performance on irregular text recognition tasks. [Check it out!](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/textrecog_models.html#read-like-humans-autonomous-bidirectional-and-iterative-language-modeling-for-scene-text-recognition)
2. We are also working hard to fulfill the requests from our community.
[OpenSet KIE](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kie_models.html#wildreceiptopenset) is one of the achievement, which extends the application of SDMGR from text node classification to node-pair relation extraction. We also provide
a demo script to convert WildReceipt to open set domain, though it cannot
take the full advantage of OpenSet format. For more information, please read our
[tutorial](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/kie_closeset_openset.html).
3. APIs of models can be exposed through TorchServe. [Docs](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_serving.html)

### Breaking Changes & Migration Guide

#### Postprocessor

Some refactoring processes are still going on. For all text detection models, we unified their `decode` implementations into a new module category, `POSTPROCESSOR`, which is responsible for decoding different raw outputs into boundary instances. In all text detection configs, the `text_repr_type` argument in `bbox_head` is deprecated and will be removed in the future release.

**Migration Guide**: Find a similar line from detection model's config:
```
text_repr_type=xxx,
```
And replace it with
```
postprocessor=dict(type='{MODEL_NAME}Postprocessor', text_repr_type=xxx)),
```
Take a snippet of PANet's config as an example. Before the change, its config for `bbox_head` looks like:
```
    bbox_head=dict(
        type='PANHead',
        text_repr_type='poly',
        in_channels=[128, 128, 128, 128],
        out_channels=6,
        loss=dict(type='PANLoss')),
```
Afterwards:
```
    bbox_head=dict(
    type='PANHead',
    in_channels=[128, 128, 128, 128],
    out_channels=6,
    loss=dict(type='PANLoss'),
    postprocessor=dict(type='PANPostprocessor', text_repr_type='poly')),
```
There are other postprocessors and each takes different arguments. Interested users can find their interfaces or implementations in `mmocr/models/textdet/postprocess` or through our [api docs](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#textdet-postprocess).

#### New Config Structure

We reorganized the `configs/` directory by extracting reusable sections into `configs/_base_`. Now the directory tree of `configs/_base_` is organized as follows:

```
_base_
├── det_datasets
├── det_models
├── det_pipelines
├── recog_datasets
├── recog_models
├── recog_pipelines
└── schedules
```

Most of model configs are making full use of base configs now, which makes the overall structural clearer and facilitates fair
comparison across models. Despite the seemingly significant hierarchical difference, **these changes would not break the backward compatibility** as the names of model configs remain the same.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/compare/v0.3.0...0.4.0

## v0.3.0 (25/8/2021)

### Highlights
1. We add a new text recognition model -- SATRN! Its pretrained checkpoint achieves the best performance over other provided text recognition models. A lighter version of SATRN is also released which can obtain ~98% of the performance of the original model with only 45 MB in size. ([@2793145003](https://github.com/2793145003)) [#405](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/pull/405)
2. Improve the demo script, `ocr.py`, which supports applying end-to-end text detection, text recognition and key information extraction models on images with easy-to-use commands. Users can find its full documentation in the demo section. ([@samayala22](https://github.com/samayala22), [@manjrekarom](https://github.com/manjrekarom)) [#371](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/pull/371), [#386](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/pull/386), [#400](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/pull/400), [#374](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/pull/374), [#428](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/pull/428)
3. Our documentation is reorganized into a clearer structure. More useful contents are on the way! [#409](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/pull/409), [#454](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/pull/454)
4. The requirement of `Polygon3` is removed since this project is no longer maintained or distributed. We unified all its references to equivalent substitutions in `shapely` instead. [#448](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/pull/448)

### Breaking Changes & Migration Guide
1. Upgrade version requirement of MMDetection to 2.14.0 to avoid bugs [#382](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/pull/382)
2. MMOCR now has its own model and layer registries inherited from MMDetection's or MMCV's counterparts. ([#436](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/pull/436)) The modified hierarchical structure of the model registries are now organized as follows.

```text
mmcv.MODELS -> mmdet.BACKBONES -> BACKBONES
mmcv.MODELS -> mmdet.NECKS -> NECKS
mmcv.MODELS -> mmdet.ROI_EXTRACTORS -> ROI_EXTRACTORS
mmcv.MODELS -> mmdet.HEADS -> HEADS
mmcv.MODELS -> mmdet.LOSSES -> LOSSES
mmcv.MODELS -> mmdet.DETECTORS -> DETECTORS
mmcv.ACTIVATION_LAYERS -> ACTIVATION_LAYERS
mmcv.UPSAMPLE_LAYERS -> UPSAMPLE_LAYERS
```

To migrate your old implementation to our new backend, you need to change the import path of any registries and their corresponding builder functions (including `build_detectors`) from `mmdet.models.builder` to `mmocr.models.builder`. If you have referred to any model or layer of MMDetection or MMCV in your model config, you need to add `mmdet.` or `mmcv.` prefix to its name to inform the model builder of the right namespace to work on.

Interested users may check out [MMCV's tutorial on Registry](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/understand_mmcv/registry.html) for in-depth explanations on its mechanism.
